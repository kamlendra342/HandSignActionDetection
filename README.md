# HandSignActionDetection ✋🤖

Welcome to the HandSignActionDetection project! This repository contains code and resources for detecting hand sign actions using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## 📚 About

HandSignActionDetection is a project aimed at recognizing and detecting various hand sign actions. The system utilizes a pre-trained model and OpenCV to accurately identify hand gestures in real-time.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Real-time Hand Sign Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time video processing.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Includes a trained model to classify different hand signs.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for testing and deploying hand sign detection.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `checking.py`: Script for checking the input data.
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for model training and evaluation.
- `nmod.h5`: Pre-trained model file.
- `opencv.py`: Script for hand sign detection using OpenCV.

## 🚀 Getting Started
